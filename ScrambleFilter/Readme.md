 This is an interesting filter where scramble effects can be chained for unusual cumulative fx. 
 
 Some are useful and interesting. Read the discussion in the forum.

 The demo comes with a number of standard effects such as negative, grayscale, mirror and resize, making it pretty useful as is. I have added flip and pixelate to my little mod, they were there begging to be implemented.. Note the XColorise option doesn't work correctly
